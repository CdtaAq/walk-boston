# walk-boston

built an application which tracks bus stops with markers from MIT to Boston

if the code loads properly you should see a map of cambridge with markers which correspond to gps cordinates for bus stops

in the future Id like to incororate traffic data aswell to show time distance between stops factoring in traffic conditions
